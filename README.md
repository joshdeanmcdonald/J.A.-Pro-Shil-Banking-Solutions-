 I care about sharing improvements.  The GPL (V2 or V3) is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms. V3 is similar to V2, but further restricts use in hardware that forbids software alterations.  Linux, Git, and WordPress use the GPL.
